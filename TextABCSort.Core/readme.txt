//PROJECT NAME - TextABCReader

//as a text reader
//For a given Text paragraph, I want to read through the paragraph where the text has been reordered and formatted as follows
		1.) Results should be ordered Alphabetically First,  (Abba before Zebra)
		2.) Results should be ordered from upper case to lower case but point 1 takes preference. (Abba before aBba)
		3.) Remove all (.,;) chars to make it easier to read.
		4.) If words are present more than once, do NOT remove duplicate words
//so that I can easily scan though the words  alphabetically

//if needed additional unit tests may be added

//insure you are happy with the project structure

//take into account we may want to swap console logger with event logger in future

//although this is a simple test, please complete the code as you would for a production release
